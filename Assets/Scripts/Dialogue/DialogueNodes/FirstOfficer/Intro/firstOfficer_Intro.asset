  - "\"Welcome aboard the Morningtide! I'm First Officer Kasheen. Glad you were able
    to make it on such short notice! \n\nWhile I'd prefer a more thorough interview
    with the captain, this is a quick refuel stop for us, and the station doesn't
    want us sitting around for more than a half-cycle. That said, are you good to
    go? No worries if you need to back out.\""
